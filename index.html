					<p>The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early
						definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a
						state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example of such a
						definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity;
						ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical,
						biological, psychological, and social stress".[3] Then, in 1948, in a radical departure from previous
						definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher, linking
						health to well-being, in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
						of disease and infirmity".[4] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it
						was also criticized for being vague and excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a
						long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions of health returning to the
						practicality of the biomedical model.[5]
					</p>
					<p>Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same
						shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the
						development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health,
						not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as "a resource for living". In
						1984, WHO revised the definition of health defined it as "the extent to which an individual or group
						is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is
						a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing
						social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities."[6] Thus, health referred to the
						ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from adverse events. Mental, intellectual, emotional and
						social health referred to a person's ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain
						relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.[5] This opens up
						many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned.
					</p>
					<p>Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Program has been a visible component of the United
						Statesâ€™ approach to improving population health.[7][8] In each decade, a new version of Healthy People
						is issued,[9] featuring updated goals and identifying topic areas and quantifiable objectives for
						health improvement during the succeeding ten years, with assessment at that point of progress or lack
						thereof. Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of
						Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health
						system. Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and
						adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health. A new expanded
						digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the
						past. The impact of these changes to Healthy People will be determined in the coming years.[10]
					</p>
					<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are
						undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the
						veterinary sciences. The term "healthy" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living
						organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy
						communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a
						person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of
						individuals. These are referred to as the "determinants of health", which include the individual's
						background, lifestyle, economic status, social conditions and spirituality; Studies have shown that
						high levels of stress can affect human health.[11]
					</p>
					<p>In the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door
						for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at
						improving human health.[12] It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in
						the presence of multiple chronic diseases or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of
						determinants of health (away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the
						prevalence of diseases).[13]
					</p>
					<p>The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early
						definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a
						state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example of such a
						definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity;

						health to well-being, in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
						of disease and infirmity".[4] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it
						was also criticized for being vague and excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a
						long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions of health returning to the
